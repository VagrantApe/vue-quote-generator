# vue-quote-generator

Some differences in this app compared to the [course project](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) were :

- Used eventBus in main.js
- Fixed bugs in webpack setup
- Broke out footer

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
